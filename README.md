## Business Objective

* The primary business objective of this code is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect phishing websites. This model can then be used to:

* Protect users: By identifying and blocking access to phishing sites, the model can prevent users from falling victim to scams, identity theft, and financial losses.

* Enhance security systems: The model can be integrated into existing security systems (e.g., web browsers, email filters, network firewalls) to provide an additional layer of protection against phishing attacks.

* Improve brand reputation: By proactively identifying and mitigating phishing attacks that impersonate their brand, organizations can protect their customers and maintain a positive brand image.

* Reduce operational costs: Automating the detection of phishing sites can reduce the manual effort required to identify and respond to these threats, freeing up security personnel to focus on other tasks.
